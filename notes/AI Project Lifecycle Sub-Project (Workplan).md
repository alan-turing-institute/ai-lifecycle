# AI Project Lifecycle Sub-Project (Workplan)
###### tags: `organisation`

## Objectives & Deliverables

The OAI [previously identified three main objectives](https://thealanturininstitute.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/PublicPolicyProgramme/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE8626D1F-6C93-4CB6-82AB-CFEF2ECB47FA%7D&file=OAI_ATI%20Secondees%20-%20proposed%20projects.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) for our work: 
* Understanding the current legal framework with respect to AI regulation
* Understanding options open for regulators to intervene
* Understanding the implications of any such intervention in terms of incentives and disincentives

We have focused on the following research areas and deliverables to specifically address these objectives:

#### Short-term deliverable

- To begin, we will organise a workshop where we can present the project lifecycle, supported by [one illustrative case study](https://hackmd.io/XjLDeauoS6GcMvUBPJkN3A), and also discuss possible opportunities for developing or refining our approach

#### Long-term 

- We will develop an accessible online workbook that provides a clear account of the value of our model and framework of the AI project lifecycle, as it applies to regulatory considerations, socioeconomic value chains, and ethical harms and benefits. This workbook will include high-quality schematics and diagrams that help users understand key topics (e.g. upstream regulatory touchpoints).
- We will prepare seven case studies based on the tasks defined by the [OECD Framework for the classification of AI Systems](https://oecd.ai/en/classification) that will serve as illustrative examples to help clarify our model and framework.
- Generalisability of regulatory touchpoints and value chains as patterns emerge to help identify and shape horizzontal copnsiderations (bottom-up and holistic approach).

The following sections provide additional information about these longer-term deliverables.

## Online Guidance

:::warning
**Note**

Although our guidance is currently being developed as an online resource, while it remains a work-in-progress, it can eventually be delivered in other formats (e.g. traditional report).
:::

To realise the aforementioned objectives we have developed a model of a typical AI project lifecyle, which is grounded in up-to-date research regarding technological, policy, and ethical considerations. To the best of our understanding, there is no other model that achieves both the same level of detail and scope as our model, while also facilitating practical deliberation and decision-making.

Our model is able to a) provide a robust and systematic method for identifying and evaluating regulatory/legislative issues as they arise throughout the AI lifecycle, b) help uncover existing and future value chains that can be enhanced or supported through regulation, and c) provides a principled means for reflecting on the ethical challenges associated with the design, development, and deployment of AI technologies [(Burr and Leslie, 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05164). 

For instance, as the following figure demonstrates, and our online workbook explains, the project lifecycle enables a clear framework for identifying the scope of specific regulatory touchpoints that serve as upstream inputs into the lifecycle's actvities and also linking key stages to downstream value chains.

Furthermore, through the use of our illustrative case studies, the online guidance will help build links between regulatory domains by demonstrating common regulatory considerations and the need for building broad and common capacity in the regulatory ecosystem.

## Case Studies

We will design and develop seven illustrative case studies (based on the tasks defined by the [OECD Framework for the classification of AI Systems](https://oecd.ai/en/classification)).

**OECD Tasks of an AI system:**

* Recognition
* Event Detection
* Forecasting
* Personalisation
* Interaction Support 
* Goal-Driven Optimisation 
* Reasoning with Knowledge Structures
:::

The purpose is to provide concrete and explanatory examples of the various regulatory touchpoints, ethical considerations, and value chains that may arise when designing, developing and deploying AI systems.

While DLA Piper is doing a top-down approach to map out the current regulatory landscape on AI regulation in the UK, we are taking a complementary bottom-up approach, illustrating the regulatory landscape and ethical considerations through concrete examples.

So far, we have focused on three tasks and associated case studies and associated:

1. Recognition: Autonomous Vehicles
2. Forecasting: Predicting the effects of interventions on health outcomes
3. Personalisation: Price discrimination

In the workshop we will present one or more of these case studies to demonstrate their purpose and function in our overarching framework. Each case study will follow a similar structure to support the ability to idnetify common patterns and generalise findings.

**Case Study Structure**

1. Summary: this section will funtion as an abstract, outlining what the case study will focus on, some background information, the main policy and regulation considerations, as well as value chains and ethical considerations.

2. Case Study: in this section, we will first have a **description** of the concrete example, (for instance, in the recognition case, we would go over the autonomous vehicles example), and the specific **category** we are focosing on (what recognition is as an AI task). We will also provide the relevant **background information** needed to understand the case study, as well as what we call '**key information**'. The latter includes: the SIC classification for the case study, who the relevant stakeholders are, the data types used, and the possible AI techniques employed. 

3. Policy and Regulation Considerations: this section will focus on the policy and regulation considerations that arise from the concrete example that is being analysed.

    We will develop:
    - Specific Issues: the significant policy or regulatory considerations that arise from the case study (in the autonomous vehicle example this would include considerations of safety or equality for example).
    - Existing Regulation or Legislation: what is already in place in UK legislation to mitigate any harms as well as support any possible benefits of the specific technology.
    - Gaps in Current Framework: which issues are currently overlooked which we think need special attention.
    
4. Value Chains 
This section will focus on the value chains that may arise from the application of this technology.
    
    For example, in the autonomous vehicle case, we will be looking at the ASDE equality impact assessment.

<!-- Can we extract evaluative criteria to use as metrics -->

5. Ethical Considerations
Finally, we want to draw special attention to the ethical considerations that are most relevant for the specific case study. These can include an ethical focus on some of the policy considerations.
