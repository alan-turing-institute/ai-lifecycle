# Forecasting: Predicting the effects of interventions on health outcomes 
###### tags: `case study`

### What is Forecasting?
Forecasting involves the prediction or estimation of a future event or phenomenon. This could include the prediction of future trends in house prices, or an estimation of the rise in global temperatures over the next 10 years as a result of climate change. 

In the context of artificial intelligence, there are many techniques that could fall within the category of 'forecasting' because of the manner in which they are deployed and used. For example, a  decision tree model could be used within a system for triaging patients during admission to hospital, based on the severity of their presenting symptoms, to predict the risk of their symptoms worsening. Although the model is performing the function of classifying data points, its use within the hospital is for forecasting health outcomes and supporting the allocation of limited resources.

In more general terms, a model or system can be described as forecasting if it takes some historical input data (D) and generates an ouput variable (O) that represents an estimate or  probabilistic value about a future trend or event.

### Case Study Overview
A university is trying to procure a digital service to support the mental health and well-being of their students, many of whom are studying remotely in response to the pandemic or are distance learners. A multi-disciplinary team of wellbeing-officers, researchers, and senior administrators working for a university have put together a call for tender to support the procurement exercise. As part of the tender, the team have requested evidence about the efficacy of the tool. 

A company specialising in digital psychiatry have submitted a proposal for a software tool that can be integrated into the university's existing online learning environment, used by students to access and upload information related to their courses, and by staff to track progress and attendance. The company are proposing to conduct a research trial with the university, as the basis for an ongoing contract if results of the trial are positive. 

The tool relies on a clustering algorithm that group's students according to the estimated level of support they may need from staff (e.g. personal tutors). To obtain this estimate, the algorithm extracts data from the university's administrative system. These include static demographic information about the student; dynamic data, such as time-stamped location data (from card used to access building); and staff-generated data, such as performance or seminar attendance. 

The developer claims that these data help build a reliable estimation of whether a student is thriving or in need of additional support. Moreover, the tool has been trained to flag students that are predicted to be "at risk". 

As evidential support for this tool, the developer provides documentation from another ongoing research study with a different university, which shows early positive results. They also include references to key publications that provide empiricial justification for its data usage and collection.
