# Personalisation and Price Discrimination

## What is personalisation?

Personalisation is a type of task an AI system can be designed to perform: it involves developing a profile of an individual based on information the AI system learns from the individual's behaviour, which it actualises and adapts over time. The output of the AI system is usually a ranking catered to that individual[^OECD], (Google's search engine ranking and Facebook NewsFeed are good examples), but it can also be one particular option presented to the individual as in cases of price discrimination we will present as follows.

## What is price discrimination? 

Price discrimination refers to the practice of firms charging different prices to different consumers based on differences in their willingness to pay for the good or service. It is important to highlight that to be considered price discrimination the difference in price must stem from the customers' difference in willingness to pay and not from, for example, how costly it is for a firm to serve the customer. That is, a difference in price due to varying shipping costs for customers in different geographical locations would not be considered price discrimination under this definition.[^FCA][^Dif]


[^FCA]: Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Research Note - Price discrimination in financial markets, How should we deal with questions of fairness? (2018).

[^Dif]: The practice of charging different prices based on different cost structures is sometimes referred to as price differentiation.

<!-- A note on terminology: in this Article, I use the term “price discrimination” in the broadest sense to denote the various methods of offering essentially the same product for different prices to different people. “Targeted pricing” denotes prices offered to the identified individuals. “Dynamic pricing” denotes prices that are updated frequently.  (Miller)-->

### Some examples of price discrimination

Price discrimination is a common practice and it can take various forms. It is generally accepted that some forms or price discrimination are overall favourable not only to the firm but also for consumers, and in fact, sometimes the practice is widely accepted in society. However, there other instances of price discrimination which can be very controversial as they can reduce overall consumer welfare.

Student and senior citizen discounts are a classic example of the former. These are mostly regarded as not only uncontroversial, but outright positive. The idea is that giving students or retirees a discount on the basis that they do not earn an income is a good thing. The underlying assumption is that having to pay full price would exclude students and retirees. Hence, in these cases, price discrimination would allow people (student and retirees) who would have otherwise been unable to access the good or service in question.[^accept]
[^accept]: Townley et al. (2017) describes different forms of price discrimination which are in general socially accepted such as volume based or multi-buy discounts, loyalty discounts, new customer discounts, peak pricing, and timing based discounts.

<!-- Add note on other accepted forms of PD from Townley p.17-19

Not all instances of price discrimination are quite so socially acceptable. In the case of student discounts, the willingness to pay of the individual is positively correlated with their wealth; people who earn more money are asked to pay more (full price) and those whose disposable income is lower (students) are given a discount.

However, most people would proabbly have the opposite reaction if the price discrimination was based not on wealth but on necessity: charging a higher price to people who desperately need the product can be met with moral outrage. For example, charging a premium to people trying to access medicine that would be life-saving for them can be seen as exploitative and cruel.

As a general rule, there are two considerations for assessing whether an instance of price discrimination is overall positive or not: (1) economic considerations and (2) fairness considerations.[^FCA]

(1)  In terms of economic considerations, the following variables need to be considered:
- Accesibility: does price discrimination increase overall consumer welfare buy making a good or service available to more customers than it would otherwise be?[^welfare] 
- Prices: does price discrimination increasen or decrease average prices?
- Competition: how does price discrimination distort competition (for example by creating barriers of entry or raising search costs)?

(2) Following Townley et al. (2017), we will focus on three distinct yet overlapping definitions of fairness:
- Perceived fairness of pricing practices;
- Fair dealing between online retailers and consumers;
- Fairness as a requirement of distributive (or collecitve) justice.

<!--Probably only going to deal with 2 and 3 only -->
<!--  Would competition law care about distributive fairness in any case? Probs not.-->

One relevant issue will occur when there are clashes between economic  and fairness considerations (when for example, price discrimination increases overall economic efficiency but is found to be distributive unfair). 
<!-- Perhaps a specific case of the needy paying more? I'm not sure -->

<!-- Economic evaluations of the efficiency (and hence desirability) of price discrimination clash directly with the perceived unfairness of price discrimination in circumstances where individuals cannot identify a legitimate substantive explanation for the price difference. (Townley) p.21 -->
[^welfare]: Note about how more overall customers does not necessarily imply a higher overall consumer welfare.

### Types of price discrimination
Traditionally, there are three types of price discrimination[^Townley]:

1. 1st degree price discrimination: The firm has perfect information about each individual consumers' willingness to pay. This means the firm is able to extract all of the consumer welfare from each individual consumer in the form of a higher price. In practice, this form of price discrimination is almost impossible to actually perform. 
2. 2nd degree price discrimination: The firm has no ex ante information about an individual consumers' willingness to pay. However, individual consumers reveal partial information about themselves through their purchasing decisions which is correlated with their willingness to pay. An example would be discounts for buying in large quantities.
3. 3rd degree price discrimination: The firm has imperfect information about an individuals’ willingness to pay, but can identify different types of consumers. Therefore the firm charges prices to different individual customers (or groups of customers) based on their observed characteristics or behaviour, e.g. discounts to senior citizens, or lower prices to new customers.

### Other classifications for price discrimination

#### Static vs Dynamic
- Static pricing: the price is kept (mostly) static throughout time, therefore the exact moment the consumer chooses to purchase is unlikely to affect the price paid. Example: buying a bottle of water at the supermarket. Even though one might come in one day and find it on sale, usually the timing of the purchase will not determine the price.

- Dynamic pricing: the price fluctuates depending on the time of purchase. Some classic examples are peak and off-peak pricing in public transport, or the increase in prices for Uber rides when the app determines a spike in demand. The key feature is that the different prices correspond to different times of purchase, and not to different consumers. That is, everyone who gets on public transport during rush hour will pay the higher price, regardless of any other differences between them.

#### Uniform vs Personalised
- Uniform pricing: this is a pricing strategy where there is no discrimination based on the consumer purchasing the good or service. Note that dynamic pricing could still be uniforms across customers. For example, the peak and off-peak fares for public transport is a dynamic pricing strategy that is uniforms across users.

- Personalised pricing: this is a pricing strategy where the price flucutuates depending on who the user is. Personalised pricing as a  practice is a subset of the wider group of price discrimination practices. 
In 2013, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)’s predecessor, the Office of Fair Trading, described it as a “relatively refined” form of the broader practice of direct price discrimination or differentiated pricing.[^PvsD]

As we can see, personalised pricing is distinct from dynamic pricing. Personalised pricing involves changing prices according to consumers' willingness to pay, while dynamic pricing variables are not consumer related. All customers buying at the same time will see the same price. 

However, it is important to highlight that both can occur in conjunction. In fact, dynamic pricing can actually facilitate the successful implementation of personalised price discrimination, because it increases the asymmetry of information between the firms and consumers, making it harder for the latter to know they are being subject to personalised pricing. If one knows prices for a certain good are static (for example, the price of a laptop), then it is relatively easy to check if one is being charged a discriminatory price (by asking a friend for instance). However, as is the case for example with airline tickets, if one knows that prices are continuously fluctuating, the price someone else paid does not necessarily give me information as to whether price discrimination is occuring.

<!-- "Personalised pricing, as so defined, is distinct from, for example, dynamic pricing. While the latter equally involves adjusting prices to reflect anticipated consumer willingness to pay, with dynamic pricing, variables are not customer related, and so all customers on a site see the same price at the same time. Traders typically use dynamic pricing to manage (and maximise revenue from) temporal variations in demand for products or services, or fluctuations in their competitors’ prices and availability. Businesses may use personalised and dynamic pricing in combination." -->




### Conditions required for price discrimination

Firms engage in price discrimination to maximise their profits via (i) a higher price, (ii) a bigger number of sales or (iii) a mix of both.  But price discrimination is not always possible. There are three key conditions[^FCA]:

1. Customers must have different willingness to pay for the good or service (also known as different price sensitivities). In a hypothetical world where everyone has the same amount of money to spend and the same identical preferences, firms would not be able to engage in price discrimination.
2. Firms must be able to distinguish between the different types of customers. Sometimes this can be relatively easy (for example, asking students to provide a student ID), but many times this is not so straightforward. Big data and advanced algorithms can provide firms with more information to aid them in discrimating in an increasingly granular, (and thus profitable) way.
3. Firms must be able to charge different prices successfully. In cases of student discounts this is easily done, as a valid student ID must be shown as proof when receiving the discount. Other times firms might do this by designing products in a way which caters to the demand profiles of the different groups. Classical examples of this are bundling products. This must be done in a way which does not allow for customers to arbitrate the price differences and just swap or resell products.

## Algorithmic Consumer Price Discrimination (ACPD)

Although there is nothing new about price discrimination per se, the technological capacities provided by Big Data and AI allows firms to engage in much more precisely targeted forms of price discrimination that had previously been impossible[^Townley]. This is done by (1) surveilling and tracking individuals' online behaviour, (2) using algortihms to learn about individuals' willingness to pay via the information collected about them, and (3) then using the insights gained to personalise the choice environments of the customers, for example, by offering them a specific price or discount catered to their willingness to pay.[^Townley]

The tracking of an individual's online behaviour can obviously lead to a more bespoke shopping experience which can be beneficial for the customer in certain aspects. The quintessential example are personalised recommendationsin everything from shopping, watching a TV show or discovering new online content in general.

However, the advances in AI systems which can provide personalised content also raise new opportunities to discriminate between consumers in a much more granular, opaque, and profitable way than had ever been possible. It is know technically feasible to discriminate on an individual-user level, and given the vast amounts of data firms have about their users, they will be able to learn about their customers' willingness to pay with increasing precision. 

ACPD allows for consumer prices to be neither uniform, transparent or universal, which violates the well-established social conventions associayes with consumer purchasing in the off-line world. (ARGUMENT P24/25)

## Applicable Regulatory Framework

Personalised pricing can have negative or positive effects. There is no direct prohibition against personalised pricing. Instead, its effects will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. 

Personalised pricing is captured by different pieces of legislation in the UK. First, the CMA will have jurisdiction where personalised pricing contravenes the Competition Act or consumer protection legislation[^CPRs]  that protects consumers from commercial practices that are considered unfair, misleading actions, misleading omissions and commercial practices which are aggressive. The CMA has defined personalised pricing as “[...]the use by businesses of information that is observed, volunteered, inferred or collected about individuals’ conduct or characteristics, to set different prices to different consumers (whether an individual or group basis), based on how price sensitive the business perceives them to be.”[^DAF]

[^CPRs]: Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs), Part 2, Article 6.

[^DAF]: https://one.oecd.org/document/DAF/COMP/WD(2018)127/en/pdf.

From the CMA’s perspective, personalised pricing is more likely to generate concerns where there is limited competition, or where consumers are unaware of, do not understand, and/or cannot avoid personalisation.Furthermore, where personalisation is based on particular characteristics of the individual consumer that may be associated with vulnerability, it is more likely to raise concerns. The CMA has noted that online markets increase the scope for personalisation and increases the information asymmetry between consumers and providers.

According to the CMA, where personalisation takes place, it is less likely to be harmful where consumers know it is happening, understand how it works and can exercise effective choice—though it notes that transparency alone will not necessarily adequately address the risk of consumer harm and the quality of disclosure is vital. 
With respect to the Competition Act, personalised pricing can potentially distort competition and subsequently breach the Chapter II prohibition of the Competition Act 1998 in circumstances where online traders abuse dominant positions by using algorithms determining the consumer’s maximum willingness to pay. Examples of possible infractions include charging excessively high prices to those customers unable to switch or using personalised pricing to exclude rivals, eg by using high prices to ‘trapped’ customers to subsidise very low prices to customers more susceptible to competition from new rivals, thus inhibiting new market entry. The CMA has noted that:[^DAF] 

[^DAF]: Ibid (page cite).

>The overall effect on competition and consumers of a given case of personalised pricing is ambiguous, and will depend not only on how those four effects balance out against each other, but also on a range of case specific factors, including, for example, (i) the intensity of competition in the market, (ii) the complexity of price personalisation (and thus how likely consumers are to understand it) and (iii) the cost to the firm of personalising offers.

Because it is not possible to state in advance whether personalised pricing will have positive or negative effects, the CMA must undertake an evidence-based assessment of the market in question. 

With respect to the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations, personalised pricing may be ruled unlawful if it is misleading, or if the underlying data about the consumer was obtained unlawfully. Examples of possible infractions include obtaining consumer data without their valid, freely given, specific, informed and active consent, contrary to data protection laws.

Second, personalised pricing may be caught by other pieces of legislation under specific circumstances. For instance, equalities legislation prohibits discrimination based on protected characteristics such as age, disability, pregnancy, gender or sexuality, marital status, race, or religion. Data protection legislation requires that consumers provide informed consent to certain forms of data gathering or when they are subjected to automated decision-making. Local legislation may restrict online retailers from offering different terms for providing the same service to consumers. And advertising and marketing law regulate online behavioural advertising, ie advertising based on a user’s data. 
 
Third, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will have oversight over personalised pricing in financial markets. The FCA has noted that personalised pricing is not in itself an unfair practice, and that a determination would have to be made on a market-by-market basis.[^2]  The Figure below illustrates the approach that will usually be taken by the FCA in personalised pricing cases to determine if there is a strong case for intervening.

![](https://i.imgur.com/GH6noCB.png)



The FCA sets out a clear framework for identifying, assessing and scaling economic harm. With respect to personalised pricing, these economic considerations will be guided by such questions as:

* Accessibility: Are more consumers able to access a good quality product due to price discrimination?
* Prices: Does price discrimination increase or decrease prices on average?
* Competition: Does price discrimination distort competition (for example by creating barriers to entry) or have other efficiency implications (for search costs for consumers too high)?
