## What is the AI Project Lifecycle?

The AI project lifecycle is a framework and model designed by the Public Policy Programme's Ethics and Responsible Innovation Team (Alan Turing Institute) to support reflective and deliberative enquiry for research or development teams.

This online guidebook introduces the AI lifecycle, using several illustrative case studies, and shows how the model can be used by regulators, policy-makers, senior decision-makers, and wider stakeholders to identify salient actions or decisions that can be taken throughout the design, development, or deployment stages of a project's lifecycle.

The goal of this framework is to foster a more trustworthy and responsible AI ecosystem.
